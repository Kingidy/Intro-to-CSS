       <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications for the internet or an intranet. It involves a
    combination of front-end development, which focuses on the visual and interactive elements that users interact with, and
    back-end development, which handles the server-side logic, databases, and application programming interfaces (APIs).
    Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and accessible user interfaces,
    while back-end developers work with server technologies such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, or databases like MySQL and
    MongoDB. Web development also includes frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Django to streamline the
    process. </p>
    <div id="test"Developers must ensure websites are optimized for performance, security, and mobile-friendliness. Additionally, tools like content management systems (CMS) help non-technical users update website content easily. Effective web development combines technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving to build functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly digital experiences.></div>
